# AI Prompt Generator

A simple Python-based tool to generate creative prompts for AI image generators and other creative AI tools.

## About This Project

This project was created as an initial step into building a portfolio on GitHub. It's a basic command-line application that randomly combines predefined subjects, actions, and styles to create unique prompts.

## How to Use

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/BlankDread/ai-prompt-generator.git`
2.  Navigate to the project directory: `cd ai-prompt-generator`
3.  Run the script: `python prompt_generator.py`

## Examples

Here are a few examples of prompts that can be generated:

*   "a steampunk robot exploring ancient ruins, in a pixel art style."
*   "a mythical dragon flying through the clouds, with vibrant neon colors."

## Technologies Used

*   Python 3

## Future Enhancements

*   Allow users to input their own keywords.
*   Add more categories for prompt components (e.g., lighting, camera angle) .
*   Develop a simple GUI or web interface.
